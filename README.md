# Course: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

In this course, I got acquainted with classical algorithms and basic data structures, implemented many of them, learned to evaluate algorithms' complexity, and chose the best ways to solve practical problems.
The repository contains training tasks that I solved independently and, the final ones for which I went through a code review.
