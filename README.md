# Course: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

In this course I get acquainted with classical algorithms and basic data structures, implement many of them, learn to evaluate the complexity of algorithms and choose the best ways to solve practical problems.
The repository contains training tasks that I solved on my own and final ones that I went through code review for.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this course:
* Sprint 1 - Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithm course
  * Time complexity
  * Space complexity
  * Search
  
* Sprint 2 - Basic data structures
  * Array, vector
  * List
  * Deque
  * Stack
  * Queue
  
* Sprint 3
  * Recursion
  * Basing sorting
  * Advanced sorting algorithms
  
* Sprint 4
